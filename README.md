# Java-Card-Game-Lesson
CS4SA Helped create Java lessons to teach an application of linked lists for three simple card games as part of middle and high school teacher professional development. Part 1 allows a user to enter their name and how many rounds to play. Part 2 allows 2 human players to play against each other. Part 3 adds tiebreaking functionality.
